Project creation: mq-otel-builder (existing)

the purpose of the project is to build the mq-otel metric exporter base on the mq-metric-samples github repositoriy (https://github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-metric-samples).

the current challenge is that we have to do a multi-arch (x86 + s390x) build with mq bindings. These need to be provided for the correct version and in the correct directory. Otherwise the build or later the execution fails.

The next step will be to change the build process from using podman to buildah.

the step afterwards will concentrat to create the binary during the image creation, so that a separate "run container" execution is not needed.
